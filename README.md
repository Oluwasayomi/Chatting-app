## 🗪 Chat App

A chatting app made with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS. Like a typical chatting app, it allows users to sign in and text other users on the app.

## 🛠 Technologies

* HTML
* Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node.js
* Vite

## 💡 Features

Here are the website's features:

* Login/Register page.
* Online users in the Contacts page.
* Chatting pages.
* Complementary colours used as background.
* Separate chat for selected users.

## ✍️ The Process

I wanted to build a chatting app for users, making it easy to tell when other users are online to message them. To start with, I drafted my plan and picked a colour scheme for the app, using complementary colours to provide an artistic visual different from the usual chatting apps we have. I then started simple, first created a simple login/register page, working mostly on the backend to ensure everything was working properly (adding APIs, environment variables, encrypting passwords, handling HTTP requests with Express, linking frontend to backend, etc). I then linked each user to the chatting app, ensuring their session and token were remembered. I then brought the chatting app page to life using structuring with React and styling with Tailwind CSS. 

Afterwards, I added interactability to the chatting app, ensuring users could select contacts and message them. I also other necessary adjustments and fixes along the way to ensure the app was functioning properly.

<!-- Once the basic website was in place, I included different styling based on the screen size, ensuring the website was adaptable for PC, tablet, and phone views. -->

<!-- Finally, I started filtering the types of art according to their respective types, putting them in their various categories. -->

<!-- Can also add 'What I Learned'(like new features, also include Overall growth), and 'How it can be improved' (This one is bullet points)  -->

## 📜 Running the project

To run the project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Install dependencies: 'npm install'.
